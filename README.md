# Social Network project
For the backend I used Express.js and Node.js, and for the frontend i used React.
After a registered account is approved by the admin, they can login and start using the network - publish posts, and write private messages to other users.

For user authentication, I used JSON web tokens as browser cookies.

- A user who registered but still wasn't activated by the admin account, cannot commit actions.

Admin login info:
Email: admin
Password: admin
